# Magnetic-Sand-Illusions

This repository contains the code and resources for generating noise videos and analyzing data from the research paper _"Magnetic Sand Illusions"_ by [Shimojo et al., BioRxiv 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.03.598775v2). The project explores the visual and perceptual phenomena of "magnetic sand" illusions, revealing how certain noise patterns can evoke illusionary motion.

A demo of the **Magnetic Sand Illusion** is available [here](https://sites.google.com/view/magneticsand).

## Usage

This repository provides Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts to generate noise videos and analyze the experimental data. Below are instructions for running the key components:

1. **Noise Video Generation:**

   To generate noise videos with different parameter combinations (e.g., varying cell size and temporal frequency), use the provided notebook:
   
   [Magnetic Sand Illusion Video Generator](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cantonsir/Magnetic-Sand-Illusions/blob/main/Videos/Magnetic_sand_illusion.ipynb)

   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cantonsir/Magnetic-Sand-Illusions/blob/main/Videos/Magnetic_sand_illusion.ipynb)

2. **Data Analysis:**

   The following Jupyter Notebooks provide a detailed analysis of different psychophysics experiments:

   - **Sensitivity to Parameters (Cell Size and Temporal Frequency)**:
   
     This notebook explores how changes in parameters like cell size and temporal frequency affect perception:

   - **Self Action vs. Observing Others**:
   
     This notebook examines differences between self-action (moving) and observing others' movement:
